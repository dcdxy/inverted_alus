1. Generate Randomized Genic Regions and Count Flanking IRAlus

This step creates randomized genic regions and counts how many are flanked by IRAlus within specified window sizes.

Instructions:
	1.	Set the desired window size
    Open the 1_R/1_generate_and_count_randomized_genic_region.sh file and set the window_size variable to one of the following values: 1000, 2000, or 5000.

	2.	Run the script
    Execute the script by running:
    source 1_generate_and_count_randomized_genic_region.sh
        •	This will generate temporary count files (e.g., result_{i}.csv).
        •	For parallelization, you can modify this script to suit your computational environment.
    
    3.	Merge temporary files
    Combine the generated result_{i}.csv files into a single file by running:
    source 2_concat_and_remove_temp_files.sh
        •	The script will produce result.csv, which contains data for 10,000 replicates of randomized genic regions flanked by IRAlus within the specified window sizes.
        •	Output file structure:
    The result file contains four columns representing:
        1.	Number of regions flanked by two any Alus.
        2.	Number of regions flanked by two non-hominoid-specific Alus.
        3.	Number of regions flanked by one hominoid-specific Alu and one non-hominoid-specific Alu.
        4.	Number of regions flanked by two hominoid-specific Alus.

2. Analysis and Visualization

Instructions:
	1.	Open and follow the Jupyter Notebook for figure generation:
    2_iPython/graph_visualization.ipynb
    
    2.	Use this notebook to visualize and analyze the results.
